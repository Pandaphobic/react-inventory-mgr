# React MUI - Inventory Manager

#### Description
This is just a super simple way to keep track of inventory. It currently parses a JSON file which was built by running the Poshmark inventory report, clipping the fat and then converting to JSON. The goal is to source this "directly" and allow for easy updating of inventory list. Eventually with export options for google sheets and interoperability with some kind of sku printing device.
